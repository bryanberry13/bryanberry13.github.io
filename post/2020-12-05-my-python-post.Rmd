Recently in class for SDS 348, we have been learning about how to use python, particularly for data science. It has been very interesting, especially considering we learned most of the same ideas and functions, but in a different syntax using R. Typically, we have been using Jupyter notebook to write code in python, but right now, this post will use Rstudio and interacting python and r chunks. To make a chunk work in python, we use {python}, insteasd of {r} at the start of a chunk. In the chunk below, Regex in python was used to scan a string for IP addresses.

```{python}
import re

string2="Jan 13 00:48:59: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 213.92.153.167 to 69.43.107.219, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \
(in: eth0 69.43.112.233(38:f8:b7:90:45:92):68 -> 217.70.100.113(00:21:87:79:9c:d9):67 UDP len:576 ttl:64) \
Jan 13 12:02:48: ACCEPT service dns from 74.125.186.208 to firewall(pub-nic-dns), prefix: \"none\" \
(in: eth0 74.125.186.208(00:1a:e3:52:5d:8e):36008 -> 140.105.63.158(00:1a:9a:86:2e:62):53 UDP len:82 ttl:38) \
Jan 13 17:44:52: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 172.45.240.237 to 217.70.177.60, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \
(in: eth0 216.34.90.16(00:21:91:fe:a2:6f):68 -> 69.43.85.253(00:07:e1:7c:53:db):67 UDP len:328 ttl:64) \
Jan 13 17:52:08: ACCEPT service http from 213.121.184.130 to firewall(pub-nic), prefix: \"none\" \
(in: eth0 213.121.184.130(00:05:2e:6a:a4:14):8504 -> 140.105.63.164(00:60:11:92:ed:1b):80 TCP flags: ****S* len:52 ttl:109)"

ip_addresses=re.findall(r"\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+", string2)
print(ip_addresses)
```



In these next few chunks, reticulate was used to show python and R communicating with each other and sharing information within Rstudio.

```{python}
x="hello world"
```

```{r}
library(reticulate)

py$x

y="hello yourself"

```


```{python}
print(r.y)
```
